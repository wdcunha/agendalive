## Tutorial source

This is a project of a tutorial from Michelli Brito [Curso Angular 9 #02 Iniciando o Projeto e inserindo Angular Material](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7vkmuYjhGQ&list=PL8iIphQOyG-DSLV6qWs8wh37o0R_F9Q_Q&index=3&t=15s).

It was used toolbar from [material](https://material.angular.io/components/toolbar/examples), as well [button raised](https://material.angular.io/components/button/overview) and [icon](https://material.angular.io/components/icon/examples). In order to organize content, it was used [tabs first](https://material.angular.io/components/tabs/examples). Some css was used to get it a little better of appearance.
